# Surfs Up Analysis

## Surfs Up Analysis Overview: 
The purpose of this analysis is to provide W. Avy more information to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round in Oahu.  Specifically, for this portion of the project, he would like to see temperature data trends for the months of June and December to help him make his final decision.

## Surfs Up Analysis Results: 
- See the June and December statistics for key differences between the two months.

  ### June Temperature Statistics:

  ### December Temperature Statistics:

- The mean or average temperature in June is 74.9 compared to 71.0 in December.
- The minimum temperature is eight degrees lower in December at 56 compared to 64 in June, but the majority of the time the temperature is in the 70s or above.
- The numbers seem relatively consistent over the two months which looks promising for opening a shop year-round.

## Surfs Up Analysis Summary: 

- In addition to providing W. Avy with a summary of the temperature statistics for the months of June and December, I believe it would be useful for him to receive the precipitation stats fort the two months as well.  See the two additional tables that will be provided to W. Avy.  It appears that the mean or average precipitation is lower in June versus December. The standard deviation is also lower in June so it seems as though the June numbers are slightly more predictable.

  ### December Precipitation Statistics:

- Given the precipitation and the temperature statistics, as well as considering the fact that schools generally are out during June, a recommendation would be to open the surf and ice cream shop in June, but the numbers look relatively close/consistent in December as well which seems promising for opening a year-round business.
